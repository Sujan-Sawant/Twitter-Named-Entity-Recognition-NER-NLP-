# Twitter-Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-NLP
***Twitter Named Entity Recognition (NER)  using Natural language processing***
- Developed Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to automatically identify entities such as person, geo-location, company, product, and media entities from large-scale Twitter data.
- Worked with annotated CoNLL-format datasets, handling sentence segmentation, token–label alignment, and sequence-level preprocessing.
- Built and evaluated model performance using entity-level precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robust extraction quality.
***Tech Stack: Python, NLP, Sequence Labeling***
